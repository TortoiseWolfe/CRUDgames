# TestingStrategy System PRP

## System Overview

### Purpose
Comprehensive testing approach covering unit, integration, E2E, and accessibility tests.

### Scope
Code quality, functionality, accessibility, and performance validation

## Core Requirements

### Testing Coverage
- Unit tests: 80% code coverage minimum
- Integration tests: Critical user flows
- E2E tests: Happy paths and error scenarios
- Visual regression: Component screenshots
- Accessibility tests: Automated and manual
